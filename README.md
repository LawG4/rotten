# Rotten

Rotten is a collection of interdependent libraries, focused on speeding up the development of graphics, games and retro projects. 

I've taken a lot of consideration when creating this repo, and I wanted to make this in Rust. However, given this projects focus on Retro systems, I think a long standing language, such as C would be more appropriate. Although I do want to provide bindings!
